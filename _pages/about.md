I am a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying the spectral properties of Type Ia Supernovae.

<!-- How did I get here?

Way back in my middle school years I remember a night out with my closest friends. We decided to take a shortcut through the woods back home, but little did we know, my friend's dad was waiting to scare the crap out of us. He did his best impression of a bear and we all scattered in terror. Running through the woods with no light, I eventually hit my head on a tree branch and was knocked flat on my back. Time stood still for a second and I remember gazing at the twinkling of the stars through the tree canopy. I took a moment and thought... "Wow... my head really hurts." 

Years later, I ended up getting a degree in engineering and using that to pursue a career in astronomy. Most people in academia will at some point question why they decided to take such an arduous path. You really have to love what you do. 

This gets me thinking. I am still here and looking for more, so I must really love what I do. I often think the reason for this is having the priviledge to spend every day following my own curiosity. But, I would be lying if "minor brain trauma as an adolescent" wasn't also a damn good explanation. -->
